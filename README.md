## Some Features of my project
* I have created a Dexter Fitness Trainer. My website homepage has a navbar, banner, footer and some important sections.

* I have added many routes relevant to my website apart from home page. And kept those routes as private routes. If a user is not logged in and wants to access those routes, the page will redirect him to the login page.

* If the user has not registered on our page before then he can go to the register route by toggling from the login route.

* If the user enters less than six passwords or does not enter an uppercase or special character in the password, an error message will be displayed on the page.And a sweet alert will show on the page when the user completes the registration or login correctly.

* When the user completes the registration or login, his name and picture will be shown in the navbar. And he can go to private routes.

* I have cretaed admin trainer and user dashboard. Users can buy three types of classes. Silver, Gold,and Diamond. and he/she can book a trainer for the classes for a specific period.

* Users can also apply to become a trainer. And only admins can assign or reject the trainer. Also he/she can see which trainers are engaged on his website.

* And after doing his bid, the bid request will go to the recruiter of that job. And then the recruiter can manage the user who bids on his job post.
